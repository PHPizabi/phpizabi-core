<p>Looks like this is your first time logging in, so lets get started!  What is generally recommended for you to do right from this point is to head over to the "My Desktop" and fill in as much information about yourself as you wish.  Remember, these are optional and not mandatory unless otherwise stated, so take your time in getting comfortable with the available settings to you through the My Desktop section.  If this isn't something you want to do right now, other suggestions on where to start would be:</p>

1)	Do a quick search for members based on what you are looking for.
2)	Head over to the chat room and meet some new people!
3)	Write you very own blog introducing yourself to the community.
4)	Browse the forums for topics that are of interest to you.

<p>These are only a few options of literally hundreds available to you for being a member of this site.  So, make yourself comfortable, get your favorite beverage, and lets get started!</p>
